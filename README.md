# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun advent calendar of coding challenges that progressively get more difficult.

These are some of my solutions.

Please note that I don't have:

- code cleanliness
- speed
- efficiency
- readability
- or any other facets of writing software

in mind while solving these fun problems. I am merely solving challenges.
